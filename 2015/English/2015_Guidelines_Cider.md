C1. [Standard Cider and Perry](https://www.bjcp.org/style/2015/C1/standard-cider-and-perry/ "Standard Cider and Perry")
=======================================================================================================================

The styles represented in this category are the principal established styles. “New World” is simply a name change from the “Common” of earlier versions.

There are known styles not represented here. In particular, Spanish (Asturian and Basque) does not yet have a style definition because there is presently insufficient appreciation and understanding, as well as a lack of commercial examples of known quality for reference.

In the case of a cider made to a style not explicitly represented here, it should be entered in the closest applicable category. The first decision is whether the cider was made with apples with significant tannin content that gives the cider noticeable astringency or bitterness. If not, it should be entered as a New World Cider. If so, the choice is between the English and French sub-categories; this decision should be based on whether the cider tends more toward sweet, rich, somewhat fruity (French) or drier and more austere (English). For perry of a non-represented style, the decision is, as above, based on tannin content. If in doubt, enter as New World Perry.

C1A. [New World Cider](https://www.bjcp.org/style/2015/C1/C1A/new-world-cider/ "New World Cider")
=================================================================================================

A New World Cider is made from culinary/table apples, with wild or crab apples often used for acidity/tannin balance. Compared to other styles in this category, these ciders are generally relatively lower in tannin and higher in acidity. “New World” references the style, not a location, as ciders in this style are also made in eastern England, Australia, Germany, etc.

Overall Impression
------------------

A refreshing drink of some substance – not bland or watery. Sweet ciders must not be cloying. Dry ciders must not be too austere.

Appearance
----------

Clear to brilliant, pale to medium gold in color.

Aroma / Flavor
--------------

Sweet or low-alcohol ciders may have apple aroma and flavor. Dry ciders will be more wine-like with some esters. Sugar and acidity should combine to give a refreshing character. Acidity is medium to high, refreshing, but must not be harsh or biting.

Mouthfeel
---------

Medium body. Some tannin should be present for slight to moderate astringency, but little bitterness.

Comments
--------

An ideal cider serves well as a “session” drink, and suitably accompanies a wide variety of food.

Characteristic Ingredients
--------------------------

Apple Varieties: Common (Winesap, Macintosh, Golden Delicious, Braeburn, Jonathan), multi-use (Northern Spy, Russets, Baldwin), crabapples, any suitable wildings.

Entry Instructions
------------------

Entrants MUST specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants MUST specify sweetness (5 categories). If OG is substantially above typical range, entrant should explain, e.g., particular variety of apple giving high-gravity juice.

C1B. [English Cider](https://www.bjcp.org/style/2015/C1/C1B/english-cider/ "English Cider")
===========================================================================================

English Cider includes the English “West Country” plus ciders inspired by that style. These ciders are made with bittersweet and bitter-sharp apple varieties cultivated specifically for cider making. English ciders are traditionally fermented and aged in wood barrels, which adds some character; however, the barrels used are rarely new, so there is no overt wood character.

Overall Impression
------------------

Generally dry, full-bodied, austere. Complex flavor profile, long finish.

Appearance
----------

Barely cloudy to brilliant. Medium yellow to amber color.

Aroma / Flavor
--------------

No overt apple character, but various flavors and esters that suggest apples, particularly tannic varieties. English-style ciders commonly go through MLF (see Introduction/Aroma-and-Flavor) which produces desirable spicy/smoky, phenolic, and farmyard/old-horse characters. These flavor notes are positive but not required. If present, they must not dominate; in particular, the phenolic and farmyard notes should not be heavy. A strong farmyard character without spicy/smoky or phenolic suggests a Brettanomyces contamination, which is a fault. Mousiness is a serious fault.

Mouthfeel
---------

Full. Moderate to high tannin, perceived as astringency and some bitterness. Carbonation still to moderate. Bottle-fermented or -conditioned ciders may have high carbonation, up to champagne levels, but not gushing or foaming.

Comments
--------

Sweet examples exist, but dry is most traditional, particularly when considering the drying contributions of tannin.

Characteristic Ingredients
--------------------------

Apple Varieties: Kingston Black, Stoke Red, Dabinett, Porter’s Perfection, Nehou, Yarlington Mill, Major, various Jerseys, etc.

Entry Instructions
------------------

Entrants MUST specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants MUST specify sweetness (dry through medium-sweet, 4 levels). Entrants MAY specify variety of apple for a single varietal cider; if specified, varietal character will be expected.

C1C. [French Cider](https://www.bjcp.org/style/2015/C1/C1C/french-cider/ "French Cider")
========================================================================================

French Cider includes Normandy styles plus ciders inspired by those styles, including ciders made by various techniques to achieve the French flavor profile. These ciders are made with bittersweet and bitter-sharp apple varieties cultivated specifically for cider making.

Traditional French procedures use small amounts of salt and calcium compounds (calcium chloride, calcium carbonate) to aid the process of pectin coagulation. These compounds may be used, pre-fermentation, but in limited quantity. It is a fault if judges can detect a salty or chalky taste. The enzyme PME (pectin methyl esterase) may also be used pre-fermentation for pectin coagulation.

Note that the sweetness/gravity levels indicate an overall tendency, not a sharp delineation between English and French ciders.

Overall Impression
------------------

Medium to sweet, full-bodied, rich.

Appearance
----------

Clear to brilliant, medium yellow to amber color.

Aroma / Flavor
--------------

Fruity character/aroma. This may come from slow or arrested fermentation (in the French technique of défécation) or approximated by back-sweetening with juice. Tends to a rich fullness. MLF notes of spicy-smoky, phenolic, and farmyard are common but not required (just as with English style), and must not be pronounced. The French expect more subtle MLF character than do the English.

Mouthfeel
---------

Medium to full, mouth-filling. Moderate tannin, perceived mainly as astringency. Carbonation moderate to champagne-like, but at higher levels it must not gush or foam.

Comments
--------

Typically made sweet to balance the tannin levels from the traditional apple varieties.

Characteristic Ingredients
--------------------------

Apple Varieties: Nehou, Muscadet de Dieppe, Reine des Pommes, Michelin, etc.

Entry Instructions
------------------

Entrants MUST specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants MUST specify sweetness (medium to sweet only, 3 levels). Entrants MAY specify variety of apple for a single varietal cider; if specified, varietal character will be expected.

C1D. [New World Perry](https://www.bjcp.org/style/2015/C1/C1D/new-world-perry/ "New World Perry")
=================================================================================================

New World Perry is made from culinary/table pears.

Overall Impression
------------------

Mild. Medium to medium-sweet. Still to lightly sparkling. Only very slight acetification is acceptable. Mousiness, ropy/oily characters are serious faults.

Appearance
----------

Slightly cloudy to clear. Generally quite pale.

Aroma / Flavor
--------------

There is a pear character, but not obviously fruity. It tends toward that of a young white wine. No bitterness.

Mouthfeel
---------

Relatively full, low to moderate tannin apparent as astringency.

Comments
--------

Some table pears may contain significant amounts of sorbitol, in which case a dry perry may give an impression of sweetness due to sorbitol in the pears. Perception of sorbitol as sweet is highly variable from one person to the next. Hence, entrants should specify sweetness according to actual residual sugar amount, and judges must be aware that they might perceive more sweetness than how the perry was entered.

Characteristic Ingredients
--------------------------

Apple Varieties: Bartlett, Kiefer, Comice, Conference, etc.

Entry Instructions
------------------

Entrants MUST specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants MUST specify sweetness (5 categories).

C1E. [Traditional Perry](https://www.bjcp.org/style/2015/C1/C1E/traditional-perry/ "Traditional Perry")
=======================================================================================================

Traditional perry is made from pears grown specifically for that purpose rather than for eating or cooking. Many “perry pears” are nearly inedible due to high tannins; some are also quite hard. Perry pears may contain substantial amounts of sorbitol, a non-fermentable sweet-tasting compound. Hence a perry can be completely dry (no residual sugar) yet taste sweet.

Overall Impression
------------------

Tannic. Medium to medium-sweet. Still to lightly sparkling. Only very slight acetification is acceptable. Mousiness and ropy/oily characters are serious faults.

Appearance
----------

Slightly cloudy to clear. Generally quite pale.

Aroma / Flavor
--------------

There is a pear character, but not obviously fruity. It tends toward that of a young white wine. Some slight bitterness.

Mouthfeel
---------

Relatively full, moderate to high tannin apparent as astringency.

Comments
--------

Note that a dry perry may give an impression of sweetness due to sorbitol in the pears, and perception of sorbitol as sweet is highly variable from one person to the next. Hence entrants should specify sweetness according to actual residual sugar amount, and judges must be aware that they might perceive more sweetness than how the perry was entered.

Characteristic Ingredients
--------------------------

Apple Varieties: Butt, Gin, Brandy, Barland, Blakeney Red, Thorn, Moorcroft, etc.

Entry Instructions
------------------

Entrants MUST specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants MUST specify sweetness (5 categories). Entrants MUST state variety of pear(s) used.

C2. [Specialty Cider and Perry](https://www.bjcp.org/style/2015/C2/specialty-cider-and-perry/ "Specialty Cider and Perry")
==========================================================================================================================

Specialty cider/perry includes beverages made with added flavorings (spices and/or other fruits), those made with substantial amounts of sugar-sources to increase starting gravities, and the beverage made from a combination of apple and pear juice (sometimes called pider).

_The same general characteristics and fault descriptions apply to specialty ciders as to standard ciders (preceding category), with the exception of added ingredients allowed._

C2A. [New England Cider](https://www.bjcp.org/style/2015/C2/C2A/new-england-cider/ "New England Cider")
=======================================================================================================

This is a cider made with characteristic New England apples for relatively high acidity, with additives to raise alcohol levels and contribute additional flavor notes.

Overall Impression
------------------

Substantial body and character. Typically relatively dry, but can be somewhat sweet if in balance and not containing hot alcohol.

Appearance
----------

Clear to brilliant, pale to medium yellow.

Aroma / Flavor
--------------

A flavorful cider with robust apple character, strong alcohol, and derivative flavors from sugar additives; traditionally dry.

Mouthfeel
---------

Substantial, alcoholic. Moderate tannin.

Comments
--------

Additives may include white and brown sugars, molasses, small amounts of honey, and raisins. Additives are intended to raise OG well above that which would be achieved by apples alone. This style is sometimes barrel-aged, in which case there will be oak character as with a barrel-aged wine. If the barrel was formerly used to age spirits, some flavor notes from the spirit (e.g., whisky or rum) may also be present, but must be subtle.

Characteristic Ingredients
--------------------------

Apple Varieties: Northern Spy, Roxbury Russet, Golden Russet, Baldwin, etc.; many traditional New England apples.

Entry Instructions
------------------

Entrants MUST specify if the cider was barrel-fermented or aged. Entrants MUST specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants MUST specify sweetness (5 levels).

Vital Statistics
----------------

### OG

1.060 - 1.100

### FG

0.995 - 1.020

### ABV

C2B. [Cider with Other Fruit](https://www.bjcp.org/style/2015/C2/C2B/cider-with-other-fruit/ "Cider with Other Fruit")
======================================================================================================================

This is a cider with other fruits or fruit-juices added – for example, berry. This is the correct style to enter a beverage fermented from a combination of apple and pear juice.

Overall Impression
------------------

Like a white wine with complex flavors. The apple character must marry with the added fruit so that neither one dominates the other.

Appearance
----------

Clear to brilliant. Color appropriate to added fruit, but should not show oxidation characteristics. (For example, red berries should give red-to-purple color, not orange.)

Aroma / Flavor
--------------

The cider character must be present and must fit with the other fruits. It is a fault if the added fruit(s) completely dominate; a judge might ask, Would this be different if neutral spirits replaced the cider? A fruit cider should not be like an alco-pop. Oxidation is a fault.

Mouthfeel
---------

Substantial. May be significantly tannic, depending on fruit added.

Entry Instructions
------------------

Entrants MUST specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants MUST specify sweetness (5 categories). Entrants MUST specify all fruit(s) and/or fruit juice(s) added.

Vital Statistics
----------------

### OG

1.045 - 1.070

### FG

0.995 - 1.010

### ABV

5% - 9%

Commercial Examples

**US** West County Blueberry-Apple Wine (MA), Bellwether Cherry Street (NY), Uncle John’s Fruit Farm Winery Apple Cherry Hard Cider (MI), Uncle John’s Fruit Farm Winery Apple Blueberry Hard Cider (MI), Uncle John’s Fruit Farm Winery Apricot Apple Hard Cider (MI).

C2C. [Applewine](https://www.bjcp.org/style/2015/C2/C2C/applewine/ "Applewine")
===============================================================================

The term for this category is traditional but possibly misleading: it is simply a cider with substantial added sugar to achieve higher alcohol than a standard cider. As such it comes closer to a white wine than any other style. No fruit other than apples may be used in this style.

Overall Impression
------------------

Typically like a dry white wine, balanced, and with low astringency and bitterness.

Appearance
----------

Clear to brilliant, pale to medium-gold. Cloudiness or hazes are inappropriate.

Aroma / Flavor
--------------

Comparable to a New World Cider. Cider character must be distinctive. Very dry to sweet, although often dry.

Mouthfeel
---------

Lighter than other ciders, because higher alcohol is derived from addition of sugar rather than juice. Carbonation may range from still to champagne-like.

Entry Instructions
------------------

Entrants MUST specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants MUST specify sweetness (5 levels).

Vital Statistics
----------------

### OG

1.070 - 1.100

### FG

0.995 - 1.020

### ABV

9% - 12%

Commercial Examples

C2D. [Ice Cider](https://www.bjcp.org/style/2015/C2/C2D/ice-cider/ "Ice Cider")
===============================================================================

This is a cider style in which the juice is concentrated before fermentation either by freezing fruit before pressing or freezing juice and removing water. Fermentation stops or is arrested before reaching dryness. The character differs from Applewine in that the ice cider process increases not only sugar (hence alcohol) but acidity and all fruit flavor components proportionately. No additives are permitted in this style; in particular, sweeteners may not be used to increase gravity. This style originated in Quebec in the 1990s.

Appearance
----------

Brilliant. Color is deeper than a standard cider, gold to amber.

Aroma / Flavor
--------------

Fruity, smooth, sweet-tart. Acidity must be enough to prevent it being cloying.

Mouthfeel
---------

Full body. May be tannic (astringent and/or bitter) but this should be slight, to moderate at most.

Characteristic Ingredients
--------------------------

Apple Varieties: Usually North American classic table fruit such as McIntosh or Cortland.

Entry Instructions
------------------

Entrants MUST specify starting gravity, final gravity or residual sugar, and alcohol level. Entrants MUST specify carbonation level (3 levels).

Vital Statistics
----------------

### OG

1.130 - 1.180

C2E. [Cider with Herbs/Spices](https://www.bjcp.org/style/2015/C2/C2E/cider-with-herbsspices/ "Cider with Herbs/Spices")
========================================================================================================================

This is a cider with any combination of “botanicals” added. Hopped ciders are included in this category. Other examples are ciders with “apple pie” spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice), ginger, lemon grass, herbal tea blends, etc.

Overall Impression
------------------

Like a white wine with complex flavors. The apple character must marry with the botanicals and give a balanced result.

Appearance
----------

Clear to brilliant. Color appropriate to added botanicals.

Aroma / Flavor
--------------

The cider character must be present and must fit with the botanicals. As with a fruit cider, it is a fault if the botanicals dominate; a judge might ask, Would this be different if neutral spirits replaced the cider? Oxidation of either the base cider or the additions is a fault.

Mouthfeel
---------

Average or more. Cider may be tannic from effect of botanicals but must not be bitter from over-extraction.

Entry Instructions
------------------

Entrants MUST specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants MUST specify sweetness (5 categories). Entrants MUST specify all botanicals added. If hops are used, entrant must specify variety/varieties used.

C2F. [Specialty Cider/Perry](https://www.bjcp.org/style/2015/C2/C2F/specialty-ciderperry/ "Specialty Cider/Perry")
==================================================================================================================

This is an open-ended category for cider or perry with other ingredients such that it does not fit any of the categories above. This includes the use of other sweeteners. A cider with added honey may be entered here if the cider character remains dominant; otherwise it should be entered as mead in the cyser sub-category. Examples also include wood-fermented or aged ciders in which the wood/barrel character is a significant part of the overall flavor profile.

Appearance
----------

Clear to brilliant. Color should be that of a standard cider unless other ingredients are expected to contribute color.

Aroma / Flavor
--------------

The cider character must always be present, and must fit with added ingredients. If a spirit barrel was used, the character of the spirit (rum, whiskey, etc.) must be no more than just recognizable; it must not be a substantial element of the flavor.

Mouthfeel
---------

Average body, may show tannic (astringent) or heavy body as determined by other ingredients.

Entry Instructions
------------------

Entrants MUST specify all ingredients. Entrants MUST specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants MUST specify sweetness (5 categories).
